## Why another SwiftUI navigation library?
- UIPilot is not a replacement for SwiftUI's `NavigationView`, it's rather a wrapper around it that you would have likely written. Thus all standard `NavigationView` features like title, swipe gesture, topbar, etc. are available by default.
- APIs are inspired by the Android, flutter, and web-based routers - Very simple and easy to use.
- Typesafe navigation - Routing to the wrong path will fail at compile time rather than runtime.
- Typesafe parameters - Routing with wrong parameters will fail at compile time rather than runtime.
- Very tiny library - it's barely 200 lines of code.

## Documentation
Visit [the website](https://canopas.github.io/UIPilot/) for documentation and more information.

## Examples
Please have a look at the [article](https://blog.canopas.com/swiftui-complex-navigation-made-easier-with-uipilot-5b33279f3476) and the [examples](https://github.com/canopas/UIPilot/tree/main/Examples) to know more about different use cases of UIPilot.

## Complex use cases
The library is designed to meet simple use cases as well as complex ones. You can also have nested `UIPilot` as many as you like!

For example, it's very easy to achieve split screen-like behavior.

Please have a look at the [article](https://blog.canopas.com/swiftui-complex-navigation-made-easier-with-uipilot-5b33279f3476) for more information of the implementation.

## Installation

Version 1.x - Uses SwiftUI `NavigationView` underneath.

Version 2.x - Uses UIKit `UINavigationController` underneath (recommended).

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding UIPilot as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/canopas/UIPilot.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.0.2"))
]
```

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods][] is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate UIPilot into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

    target 'YourAppName' do
        pod 'UIPilot', '~> 2.0.2'
    end
